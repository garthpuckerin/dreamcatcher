- ✅ Share business logic with web app
- ✅ Large ecosystem and community

### Key Mobile Features

1. **Quick Capture**
   - Voice-to-text for instant capture
   - Share from any app
   - Camera/screenshot integration

2. **Full Functionality**
   - Create/edit dreams and fragments
   - Search and filter
   - Timeline and consolidated views

3. **Offline-First**

   - Local SQLite/Realm storage

4. **Native Integration**
   - Push notifications
   - Widgets (iOS/Android)
   - Biometric security
   - Gestures and haptics
